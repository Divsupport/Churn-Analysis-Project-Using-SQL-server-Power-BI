# Churn-Analysis-Project-Using-SQL-server-Power-BI
I Analyzed 7,040 telecom customer records to identify churn drivers and design retention strategies. Built an end-to-end analytics pipeline: SQL ETL for data cleaning, Power BI for visualization, and actionable insights to reduce churn by 15% ($720K annual savings).

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

1. **ETL Pipeline**: I set up a Microsoft SQL Server database (`Churn_db`) to stage, clean, and transform raw customer data.
2. **Data Exploration**: I analyzed customer demographics, service subscriptions, payment info, and churn status to uncover retention drivers.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: I developed an interactive report with key metrics, custom segments, and AI-powered narratives.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**: I identified high-risk segments (e.g., women 50+), service gaps, and contract/payment vulnerabilities, and proposed targeted campaigns.
5. **Future Enhancements**: I laid out next steps for predictive modeling, automated ETL refreshes, and A/B testing.



1. Churn Analysis Overview In todayâ€™s competitive market, retaining customers is key to long-term success. Churn analysis helps identify why customers leave by analyzing behavioral patterns and trends. Using machine learning and data analytics, businesses can predict churn and take proactive steps to improve loyalty.

1.1 Target Audience While this project focuses on a telecom company, the insights apply across industriesâ€”retail, banking, healthcare, and more. It explores practical strategies and tools to reduce churn and enhance customer retention through data-driven decisions.
