# Churn-Analysis-Project-Using-SQL-server-Power-BI
I Analyzed 7,040 telecom customer records to identify churn drivers and design retention strategies. Built an end-to-end analytics pipeline: SQL ETL for data cleaning, Power BI for visualization, and actionable insights to reduce churn by 15% ($720K annual savings).

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

1. **ETL Pipeline**: I set up a Microsoft SQL Server database (`Churn_db`) to stage, clean, and transform raw customer data.
2. **Data Exploration**: I analyzed customer demographics, service subscriptions, payment info, and churn status to uncover retention drivers.
3. **Power BI Dashboard**: I developed an interactive report with key metrics, custom segments, and AI-powered narratives.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**: I identified high-risk segments (e.g., women 50+), service gaps, and contract/payment vulnerabilities, and proposed targeted campaigns.
5. **Future Enhancements**: I laid out next steps for predictive modeling, automated ETL refreshes, and A/B testing.


## Churn Analysis Introduction 

In today's competitive corporate environment, customer retention is 
critical to long-term success. One important method for 
comprehending and lowering this client attrition is churn analysis. It 
entails looking at customer data to find trends and explanations for 
why customers leave. Businesses may identify which clients are 
most likely to leave and comprehend the variables influencing their 
choices by utilizing machine learning and advanced data analytics. 
With this information, businesses may take proactive measures to 
increase client loyalty and happiness.

## Who is the Target Audience? 
The methods and insights used in this research are applicable to a variety of 
businesses, even though it concentrates on churn analysis for a telecom 
company. This Churn research is useful for any company that values keeping 
customers, from retail and banking to healthcare and beyond. I will examine 
the strategies, resources, and best practices for enhancing customer loyalty 
and lowering attrition while turning data into useful insights for long-term 
success.
